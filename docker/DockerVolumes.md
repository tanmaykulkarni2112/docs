# Docker Volumes

Persistent data to be used with Docker containers can be managed using Docker volumes. Docker volumes are a preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside the container's filesystem, allowing data to persist even when the container is removed.

**Key Points:**
- Volumes are managed by Docker and can be easily backed up or migrated.
- They can be shared between multiple containers.
- Changes to the data in a volume are immediately reflected in all containers using that volume.

**Creating a Volume:**
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

**Using a Volume in a Container:**
```bash
docker run -v my-volume:/data my-image
```

**Listing Volumes:**
```bash
docker volume ls
```

**Removing a Volume:**
```bash
docker volume rm my-volume
```

**Note:** Be cautious when removing volumes, as this will delete all data stored in the volume.
